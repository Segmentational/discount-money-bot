# Discount Money Bot
snag the best deals from [@tendmoney](https://twitter.com/tendmoney)'s [popup shop](https://discountmoneystore.com/)

## Technologies
* Python 3.X
* Selenium
* Twint
* A few more basics

## Installation
_I might build standalone executables later_
* Clone the repository to a local directory
* Install the dependencies

## Usage
* Run `minion.py` (looks for restocks since the time it was launched)
* Type in checkout details at launch
* Log into PayPal in the browser when prompted
* let the bot handle the rest (see [demo video](https://youtu.be/YHFMMb7r71c) for normal operation)

## Disclaimers & Notes
* Primarily: be considerate⁠—just buy something once
* Use at your own risk
* Make sure your default PayPal payment method has enough money/credit available to make the purchase
* Could _definitely_ be cleaned up, open to pull requests
